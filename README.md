  #Babble
  
Babble is a freeware and native android instant messaging service. The application allows the users to send text messages or images. It runs on the native android device and uses services from Firebase like standard Id generation at the time of registration or Realtime Database. Users could only communicate with another user individually after accepting the friend request. Also, unlike other messengers, it is built on a modern concept of serverless computing. It makes it highly scalable and easily integrated to any cross-platform devices.
